# rotating_rotator
A personal, terrible enigma machine

I'm writing this crypotgraphy device because it's fun. I'm not qualified to audit the security of this, there are better products that are easier to use. I'm making this because I want to and because it's fun. If it's decently secure that's just a bonus TBQH and you've been warned.

Requirement:
So far only cryptography~=3.2.1


Just run rotating_rotator after cloning, and follow the prompts. You will be:

1. Creating two keys, a Fernet .key  file and a position .txt file which will be encrypted with the first key.
2. Writing a text document in the top window, when prompted. Press the encrypt button to scramble the letters before saving.
3. Make sure to save it as a new document each time for now, while a process to append is sorted out

More detailed info to come

Does this work? Lets test it out, can anyone decrypt this without the keys?
