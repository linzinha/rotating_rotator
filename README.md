A personal, terrible enigma machine

I'm writing this crypotgraphy device because it's fun. I'm not qualified to audit the security of this, there are better products that are easier to use. I'm making this because I want to and because it's fun. If it's decently secure that's just a bonus TBQH and you've been warned.
